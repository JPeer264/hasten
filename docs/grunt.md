# Basic Gruntfile for `hasten`
> overview of the basic Gruntfile.js generated by `hasten`

## Getting started

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you can start to optimize this Gruntfile.

## Gruntfile and Plugins

The `hasten` generated Gruntfile contains two different things: the paths and the registration of all the tasks. All the plugins are outsourced and in the directory `./config/grunt/`

### Plugins

You may recognize that the plugins are sorted in different categories. That is because every plugin has a function like **managing the code**, such as `grunt-contrib-concat` or `grunt-sass`, or are just here to **help with the production**, such as `grunt-contrib-watch` or `grunt-contrib-connect`. And it is easier to manage if some plugins work together, like `watch` and `connect`.

## Usage

With this Gruntfile you can do different things: 
- **Lint**. Check your code, based on the `.eslintrc` in the dir `./config/eslint/`
- **Test**. Test your code with mocha
- **Reports**. Generate reports for different Continuous Integration Systems
- **LiveCoding**. See what you code directly in your browser
- **Ready-to-Deploy**. Generates optimized code with little space

### Grunttasks

There are different main Grunttasks, which are important for developing and for Continuous Integration Systems. Some task have some subtask like `:dev`, `:prod`, `:ci` or `:reports` depending on their function. Here are the main tasks you may use for developing and production:

#### `grunt lint` 

To lint CSS, JS and HTML Files

*Subtasks*
- `:dev` Just in console
- `:ci` Just in console
- `:reports` Generates reports into `./tmp/reports`

#### `grunt test`

To test the `.spec.js` files in every subfolder

*Subtasks*
- `:dev` Just in console
- `:ci` Just in console
- `:reports` Never fails, makes reports

#### `grunt reports`

Generate test, coverage and lint reports

#### `grunt build`

Build all the files of the `./src` folder

*Subtasks* 
- `:dev` Build into `./tmp`
- `:prod` Build into `./dest`, optimized for production
- `:ci` Build into `./dest`, optimized for production

#### `grunt serve`

Starts a server for livecoding in the browser

*Subtasks*
- `:dev` Open `./tmp`
- `:devphp` Starts a PHP server and open `./tmp`
- `:docs` Shows the documentation using `grunt-jsdoc`
- `:reports` Shows the test reports in the browser
